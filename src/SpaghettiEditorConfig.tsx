English is my second language with many difficulties that I faced them in
twolast years I moved in United States .
//

In my homeland we didn’t write as structural as here .
//

During the semester , I frustrated many times with my grades and thought I
couldn’t go up any more , because there was a very big difference between
ESOL 40 with other language people .
//

Sometimes , I recognized about why I’m here and studying with this crazy
language that I couldn’t be good at all .
//

In contrast I faced with my beliefs and challenges that helped me to focus
on my mind to write an essay with these difficult subjectswith no experience
as narrative essay , business essay and all argumentative essays .
//

It makes me proud of myself to write something I never thought I can do
in end of this semester and improve my writing skills , have learned my
challenges and discovered strategies to overcome the challenges .
